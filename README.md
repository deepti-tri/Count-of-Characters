# Count-of-Characters

Given a string, you need to find the total count of characters in the word.

Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.

Create a program that takes the word as input, calculates and outputs the total count as a number.


```
Sample Input:
hello

Sample Output:
52
```
Explanation:

```
h = 8, e = 5, l = 12, o = 15
Sum = 8 + 5 + 12 + 12 + 15 = 52
```

NOTES:
- All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.
- The Java Scanner class is part of the `java.util` package and [will handle user input](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/scanner).
